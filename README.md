Introduction
**************************
This locker rental program is written to work in conjuction with the library ILS, Alma. 
You may see it live at [http://vm.library.reed.edu/circ/lockers](http://vm.library.reed.edu/circ/lockers).

Here's how it works: the user clicks on the image of the locker a student wants, scans the student's barcode, or types the student's network login or college ID, and clicks 'Assign Locker'. The locker number, student information, and date is recorded to a database. A note containing the locker number is posted in the student's Alma record (Alma automatically includes the date). We charge $5 for our lockers, and that amount is assumed. 

The administration page is a table of information pulled from the database so we can see who has which locker. For combination lockers, it allows us to update the combinations. 

Please see the wiki for screenshots of the program in action.
